                    <h3>
                        The everyday lives of people are already heavily reliant on technology. One example is that every personâ€™s daily driver is their phone. People nowadays cannot function without the assistance of technology. Businesses today save a lot of money and time by leveraging technology to do specialized jobs without the assistance of a person. When compared to the cost of hiring an individual to perform the task and ensuring that it is completed on time, it is prohibitively expensive.
                        Most organizations nowadays want to operate smoothly with the aid of technology, which saves energy, money, and time. As an example, consider the employment of technology in communication. It is now quite simple to converse with others. Instead of travelling to the post office to mail a business communication, people may now generate a draft and then email, fax, or even utilize a messenger to deliver it to a recipient in seconds without any delays. Technology has also simplified the creation of documents or quotations for business transaction enquiries, as well as the storage of all of this information depending on who the customer is, without the need of physical papers, which can be lost or destroyed. This paper will concentrate on the family firm BELERON Enterprises. The name of this application was derived from the title. BELERON Enterprises, which is run by the researcher's grandpa, is still not using these functions. The company does not use an automated transaction system, does not create papers or quotations, does not save vital data, and does not have its own internet application.
                        This project system will make it easier to create papers or quotations since it will now use a preset layout without the need for paper and will restart if there is an error in the information. The system will also make it easier to arrange and identify all clients based on the date of the papers or estimates that were transacted or queried since it will save and retrieve information automatically.
